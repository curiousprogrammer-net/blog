Since 2010, I’ve been interested in functional programming and non-Java JVM languages, most notably Scala & Groovy.

However, whenever I tried to learn Scala, I ended up confused. I started with a passion, but the complexity of the language perplexed me. I love the ideas of Functional Programming:

- pure functions
- avoiding mutable state
- no side effects

But I’ve found it difficult to write clean code in Scala. I never really understood the language. I felt it was a way harder to learn it properly than it should be.

On the other side, Groovy is easier to understand, but I can't see much of value to justify using it in production. Sure, I've used it quite a lot for unit testing and even for some scripting, but I've never gotten much further.

### My way to Clojure

Around 2013, I heard about Clojure and got interested. This was the first time I met a strange LISP-like language with all those braces. I read a chapter about Clojure in the book [The Well-Grounded Java Developer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617290068/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1617290068&linkCode=as2&tag=jumarkocuriou-20&linkId=cac7048d40d7bb15caf0ecd2952f5eff)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jumarkocuriou-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1617290068). At the beginning, I wasn’t very convinced that Clojure code is more beautiful or readable than Java code., but I was getting curious.

From time to time, I read some article about Clojure, played a little bit with it and even watched some of [Rich Hickey's talks](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy). I discovered fantastic and thriving [Clojure community](https://clojure.org/community/resources) ([Clojurians slack](http://clojurians.net/) is awesome). I bought a copy of [The Joy of Clojure](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617291412/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1617291412&linkCode=as2&tag=jumarkocuriou-20&linkId=e4c19deee69f1348982d4249badf732b)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jumarkocuriou-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1617291412), started to read it - and failed eventually. I wasn’t prepared.

For some reason, I still felt the growing need to explore and learn about this new world:

- Why is that everyone in Clojure community is so excited about the language?
- Does it really bring fun to programming again?
- What are these immutable data structures and why are they so useful?
- What does it feel like to use a dynamic language on a large scale?
- Can we indeed write a concurrent code in a less painful and a more reliable way?
- How can I leverage the power of Macros?
- What are the benefits of using (almost) the same language on backend and frontend? (Clojure vs. ClojureScript)
- Are the big systems written in Clojure, in fact, so much more compact than their Java counterparts while still being readable and maintainable?

**This blog is my attempt to answer those questions.**
