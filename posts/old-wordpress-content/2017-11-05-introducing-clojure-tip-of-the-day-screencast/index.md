title: "Introducing Clojure Tip of the Day Screencast"

I've started a new Clojure screencast Clojure Tip of the Day. It's going to be a collection of short (~5 min) videos covering various Clojure tips, tools, and techniques. I'd like to add a new episode at least once a week.

The first episode is about Cider debugger. It was inspired by a comment on my [Clojure Development Workflow with Spacemacs and Cider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ecC3jqHooc) video tutorial.

You can find the episode on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHCch3-Yuac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHCch3-Yuac).

See [Cider Debugging documentation](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging/) for more details.
