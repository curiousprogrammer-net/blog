There's going to be a very interesting functional meetup _**LambdUp**_ in Prague (CZ) on 6th December 2017 organized by [Blueberry](https://www.blueberry.io/).

I first heard about the event from Eric Normand at Clojure/conj 2017 in Baltimore. It's not a coincidence that Eric is also one of the speakers invited to the meetup:

- [Eric Normand](https://twitter.com/ericnormand) -  A theory of Functional Programming
- [Tomáš Petříček](https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek) - Functional-fist Programming with F#
- [Claudio Ortolina](https://twitter.com/cloud8421) - Flexible Elixir
- [Christophe Grand](https://twitter.com/cgrand) - Naming is Hard; or The Value of Values
- [Andrea Magnorsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnorsky/) - What's next? A friendly guide to your next programming language
- [Aleš Roubíček](https://twitter.com/alesroubicek) - Clojure for Machine Learning
- [Andrea Leopardi](https://twitter.com/whatyouhide) - Property-based Testing is a Mindset

It's a real shame that I cannot visit the meetup since I'm away at that time, but if you happen to be around, give it a shot. You can find more  at [https://www.lambdup.io/](https://www.lambdup.io/)
