After a long break, I've finally recorded another episode of the [Clojure Tip of The Day screencast](https://curiousprogrammer.net/clojure-tip-of-the-day-screencast/). I've spent last month or so by revisiting my goals for the next year and I want to bring more consistency to my blog and other creative activities.

This episode is about thread-first (->), thread-last (->>), and thread-last (as->) macros. Again, you can find it on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CxOHmny80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CxOHmny80)

The next episode will be about _some->_, _some->>_, _cond->_, and _cond->_.

You can find the source code on GitHub in [curiousprogrammer-net/clojure-tip-of-the-day repository](https://github.com/curiousprogrammer-net/clojure-tip-of-the-day/blob/master/src/clojure_tip_of_the_day/004_threading_macros.clj).
