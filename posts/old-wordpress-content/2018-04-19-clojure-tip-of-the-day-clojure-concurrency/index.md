I've made a short "welcome" video for a new _Clojure Concurrency_ series.

You can find it on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/LKomnPz4Kek](https://youtu.be/LKomnPz4Kek).

Starting with this episode I probably won't make a separate blog post for each episode. Instead, I'll attach all notes to the [Clojure Tip of the Day screencast page](https://curiousprogrammer.net/clojure-tip-of-the-day-screencast/).
