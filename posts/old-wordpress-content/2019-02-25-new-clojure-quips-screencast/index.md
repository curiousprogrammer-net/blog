It's been a while since I recorded the last [Clojure Tip of the Day episode](https://curiousprogrammer.net/2018/04/19/clojure-tip-of-the-day-clojure-concurrency/).

I've been thinking a lot about the possibilities how to evolve this further and have found that it's a really time-consuming effort and there are also other high-quality websites covering those sorts of topics (as an example, check out wonderful [Clojure Concurrency course from PurelyFunctional.tv](https://purelyfunctional.tv/courses/concurrency/)).

So I decided to switch my focus on something that I could consistently do on a semi-regular basis and that means really short videos focused on a single concept or a function from Clojure standard library or other interesting Clojure libraries and tools.

Today, I'm announcing a weekly _**[Clojure Quips](https://curiousprogrammer.net/clojure-quips/)**_ [screencast](https://curiousprogrammer.net/clojure-quips/).

The [first episode is already on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlucNAvwqg0&feature=youtu.be).

Enjoy!
