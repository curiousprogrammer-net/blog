I gave a talk at [GDG Jihlava](https://twitter.com/GDGJihlava) yesterday about [CodeScene](https://codescene.io), a unique behavioral code analysis tool that I'm grateful to work on.

The talk was given in Slovak (full details are available at the [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/gdgjihlava/events/265293406/)).
