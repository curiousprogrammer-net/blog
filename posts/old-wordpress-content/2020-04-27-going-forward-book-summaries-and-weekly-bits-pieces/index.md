It's been a while since my last post and I've been very inconsistent in publishing new content. But I want to publish interesting content which both I (reviewing & sorting out materials) and other readers could benefit from.

As an experiment, I created two new pages which I want to keep adding content continuously:

- **Book Summaries**: [https://curiousprogrammer.net/book-summaries/](https://curiousprogrammer.net/book-summaries/)
- **Weekly Bits & Pieces** [https://curiousprogrammer.net/weekly-bits-pieces/](https://curiousprogrammer.net/weekly-bits-pieces/)

The first "bits" should appear within a week.
